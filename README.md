# Week 1 Challenge - Code Refactor for Marketing Agency

The purpose of this week's challenge is to refactor existing HTML markup and CSS styling for the website of a marketing agency. In the process, I looked to optimize the HTML structure logic and the appropriateness of HTML tags for particular segments of the website, and generally organized and improved the readability of the existing codebase; additionally, I wished to improve the efficiency of the CSS styling declarations. In the CSS stylesheet, there was a significant opportunity to improve with respect to the specificity of selector statements; a lot of CSS styling was repetitive and could be generalized to decrease the total number of lines of code in the style sheet. For example, the two images below show I am able to condense 24 lines of CSS coding into just 8 (well, 9 if you include the font-family property:value declaration in the <body> styling section I added).
